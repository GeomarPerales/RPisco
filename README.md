# YUPANA : tools for analyzing extreme precipitation events.

## 1. Overview

This R package provides a set of tools for analyzing extreme precipitation events based on daily maximum precipitation records. It includes functions for fitting probability distributions (e.g., Normal, Gumbel, Log-Normal), estimating return periods, and visualizing extreme value behavior. The package is designed to support hydrological and climatological studies, infrastructure design, and risk assessment related to intense rainfall events.
